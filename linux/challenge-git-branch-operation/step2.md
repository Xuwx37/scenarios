# Make Changes to a File in the New Branch

## Introduction

After creating a new branch, you can make changes to files in the branch without affecting the main branch.

## Target

Your goal is to make changes to a file in the new branch.

## Result Example

Here's an example of what you should be able to accomplish by the end of this step:

1.  Make changes to a file in the new branch.

Use the following command to switch to the new-branch branch:

```shell
git checkout new-branch
```

This will switch you to the new branch so that any changes you make will be made in that branch. Open the file you want to make changes to and make the necessary changes. Save the changes to the file and exit the editor.

## Requirements

To complete this step, you will need:

- A Git repository with at least one commit.
- A new branch created using the branch command.
