# Summary

To complete this challenge, you will need a Git repository with at least one commit and a basic understanding of Git concepts like commits, branches, and the staging area. You will follow four steps: creating a new branch using the `branch` command, making changes to a file in the new branch, switching between branches using the `checkout` command, and merging changes from the new branch back into the main branch using the `merge` command. Now you maybe have a better understanding of how to manage branches and changes in your Git repository.
