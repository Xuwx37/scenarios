# Switch between Branches Using the Checkout Command

## Introduction

The `checkout` command is used to switch between branches in your Git repository.

## Target

Your goal is to switch between branches using the `checkout` command.

## Result Example

Here's an example of what you should be able to accomplish by the end of this step:

1. Switch between branches in the repository using the checkout command.

If you are not on the new-branch branch, use the following command to switch to it:

```shell
git checkout new-branch
```

This will switch you to the new-branch branch. If you want to switch back to the main branch, use the following command:

```shell
git checkout main
```

This will switch you back to the main branch.

## Requirements

To complete this step, you will need:

- A Git repository with at least one commit.
- A new branch created using the branch command.
- Changes made to a file in the new branch.
