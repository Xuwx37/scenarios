# Create a New Branch

## Introduction

The `branch` command is used to create a new branch in your Git repository. Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes without interfering with the main codebase.

## Target

Your goal is to create a new branch in the repository using the `branch` command.

## Result Example

Here's an example of what you should be able to accomplish by the end of this step:

1. Create a new branch in the repository using the branch command.

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Git repository. Run the following command to create a new branch called new-branch:

```shell
git branch new-branch
```

This will create a new branch in your repository, but you will still be on the main branch.

## Requirements

To complete this step, you will need:

- A Git repository with at least one commit.
- A basic understanding of Git concepts like commits, branches, and the staging area.
