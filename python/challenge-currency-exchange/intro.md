# Currency Exchange

Currency exchange is the act of converting one currency into another currency. It is necessary for international trade and investment. The value of a currency can fluctuate based on economic and political factors, so currency exchange rates are constantly changing. Python can be used to create functions that help with currency exchange, such as converting one currency into another and calculating exchange rates.
